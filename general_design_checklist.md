# Parts and Other Research

Looks like implementing a recharge circuit for a LiPO battery would not be too much trouble. The 3PEAK TPB4056B2X-ES1R single cell battery charger appears to be able to charge (correctly) a wide range of LiPO capacities.

Datasheet in folder, single price is $0.91.

Looks like a single resistor controls the charge current, and the temperature monitoring feature can be disabled.

A 420mAh LiPO battery should be sufficient for my purposes. Charge rate to be determined, should be about 200mA.
